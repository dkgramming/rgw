Really Good Weights
===
Really Good Weights (RGW) is a simulation of intelligent boids.

Overview
---
I’m currently designing an application that will combine Craig Reynold’s steering algorithms and machine learning techniques. The concept is that there will be a client-side simulation with autonomous vehicles driven by the steering algorithms. These vehicles will navigate through an environment with various obstacles, and their goal will be to collect items as quickly as possible without colliding with obstacles. Data recorded during the simulation and persisted to a database. This data will be ingested by a machine learning algorithm which will optimize the numerical values used in the steering algorithms. The goal of this is maximize the rate at which the vehicles collect items in the environment, and to minimize the number collisions with obstacles.
